## Installation Steps
### ( Entisys360 Internal Beta release )

To complete the installation of the Desktop360 product, there are two phases:

### Phase 1: Complete the initial configuration form data fields, and Submit.

The initial automation and configuration will build the preliminary environment resources into the customer's subscription of choice. Email notifications are then sent to the customer and internal Entisys360 sales/support staff.

The internal sales and support staff will follow through with the email notifications to then work with the customer to complete the following steps:
- Establish connectivity from Azure to On-Premises (VPN, Meraki, etc)
- Connect the Domain to Azure Domain Servers
- Establish a Citrix Site


### Phase 2: Automated Citrix Cloud over Azure solution Delivery

With the domain connected and the Citrix Cloud Site setup, Entisys360 support staff will validate all environment settings and lastly trigger the second phase of the automated installation.

The customer will receive notice of the environment stand-up, access to key resources, and additional instructions and documentation.
